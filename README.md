### bioinformatic_scripts_for_the_lost
I'm often lost when it comes to editing my own .fasta files, so I wanted to leave some useful scripts here.

I'll be updating this repository and commenting whenever I find something useful.

Please do keep in mind that my coding abilities aren't that impressive, so I may be using some scripts found on the Internet and editing them here.
